   <h1>Goal: To Show How Does Basketball Work</h1>
<p>Basketball is more than the slam-dunks shown on television sports shows. Basketball requires only a basket, a ball, and at least two players. A team can score a field goal by shooting the ball through the basket during regular play. A field goal scores three points for the shooting team if the player shoots from behind the three-point line, and two points if shot from in front of the line. A team can also score via free throws, which are worth one point, after the other team is assessed with certain fouls. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but overtime is issued when the score is tied at the end of regulation. The ball can be advanced on the court by throwing it to a teammate, or by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling). Basketball teams have player positions, the tallest and strongest teammates of a team are called a center or power forward, while shorter and more athletic players are called small forward, and the shortest players or those who haves the best ball handling skills are called a point guard or shooting guard. The point guard directs the on court action of the team and one of the main position. The first game was played by shooting a ball into a peach basket nailed to a railing, and the ball had to be retrieved with a long dowel after each successful shot. Fast-forward through the decades and names like Jordan, Shaq, Kobe, and LeBron are almost immortal. Basketball is one of the most entertaining, challenging, and exciting sports in the world. You can learn the basic rules and the fundamental skills  to play.</p>
